# Responsive Landing Page

## Overview
As part of my web development journey, I created a responsive landing page. The goal was to design a visually appealing and user-friendly page that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: The landing page adjusts gracefully to various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Fluid Layout**: I used flexible grids and media queries to ensure content flows smoothly across different viewports.
- **CSS Flexbox and Grid**: Leveraging modern CSS techniques, I organized elements efficiently and maintained a clean layout.
- **Media Optimization**: Images and other media assets were optimized for faster loading times.
- **Interactive Elements**: The landing page includes interactive buttons, forms, and animations.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Flexbox and Grid)
- JavaScript (for any interactivity)
